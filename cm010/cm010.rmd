## Today's Lessons

Today's lessons are:

- Two-table verbs
- Combine data sets

## Resources

Concepts from today's class are closely mirrored by the following resources, which introduce `dplyr` functions for joining two data.frames or tables.

The following are good walk-throughs:

- [r4ds: Relational data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) chapter.
    - Contains examples  with visualization
- The [intro to two-table vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html) is also a great resource.

Here are some other resources you might find useful:

- [Jenny's tidying data tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy).
    - Has a lot of examples, but less dialogue.
- [`Data Wrangling` cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
    - Has simple examples with visualization.
    
## Participation

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the [cm010-exercise.Rmd](https://github.com/Rashedul/stat545_guest_lecture/blob/master/cm010-exercise.Rmd) file, and adding it to your participation repo. 

Let's get set up:

1. Go to the [class exercise](https://github.com/Rashedul/stat545_guest_lecture/blob/master/cm010-exercise.Rmd) file.
2.  Copy the raw text.
3. Create a new Rmd file from Rstudio and paste the raw text. Save the file named- `cm010-exercise.Rmd`.
4. _Optional, but recommended_: Stage and commit the Rmd file (you can do this through RStudio).
    - You can still get participation marks by uploading the final files to GitHub.

# Two-table verbs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Know the verbs that work with pairs of data.frames/tables.
- Learn about differnt families of verbs

## Discussion

Why `dplyr` for data.frames/table joining?

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to access and manipulate  relational data
- In `dplyr` concepts are simiar to SQL, although their expression in `dplyr` is a little different
- `dplyr` is specialised to do data analysis but SQL is not

--There are several families of verbs that include--

- Mutating joins
- Filtering joins
- Set operations
- Binding

# Combine data sets 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Have a sense of different types of joining  data.frames and the arguments required in `dplyr`'s join functions
- Have a sense of four types of mutating joins and two types of filtering joins
- Have a sense of `set` operations for data.frames/tables
- Have a sense of binding two data.frames/tables by rows or columns

## Discussion

Mutating joins combine variables from the two data.frames/tables e.g., `a` and `b`. `dplyr` supports four types of mutating joins

- `left_join(a,b)`
- `right_join(a,b)`
- `inner_join(a,b)`
- `full_join(a,b)`

Filtering joins keep cases from the left-hand data.frame/table. 

- `semi_join(a,b)`
- `anti_join(a,b)`

There are three set operations for two data.frames/tables e.g., `y` and `z`.

- `intersect(y, z)`
- `union(y, z)`
- `setdiff(y, z)`

Binding rows or columns from the two data.frames/tables. `dplyr` supports tow types of binding

- `bind_rows(y, z)`
- `bind_cols(y, z)`

There are several arguments 

- __two tables__
- __by which column__
- Copy
- Suffix
- etc.

Example pseudocode: `joinFunction(df1, df2, by = "which column")`

__Other implementations of join functions:__ base::merge() can perform all four types of mutating joins.


| dplyr   |      merge      |  
|----------|:-------------:|
| `inner_join(x, y)` |  `merge(x, y)` | 
| `left_join(x, y)` |    `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE)`   | 
| `right_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y, all.y = TRUE)` |
| `full_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)` |
| | |

Advantages of using `dplyr` for joining

- `dplyr` verbs clearly conveys the intent of the code
- `dplyr`â€™s joins are considerably faster

# Live coding and demonstration of combining data sets

## Learning Objectives

This live-coding-based lesson focusses on: 

- using the join functions for data.frames/tables, while
- using conditions for joining, filtering, set operations and binding

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- Join, split or combine variables from data.frames/tables under the following situations:
    - matching by columns
    - matching by rows

## Demonstration

Note: We will use the join, set and binding functions with simple examples as well as do some in class practices with `nycflights13` dataset.

Follow along with the [`cm010-exercise.Rmd`](https://github.com/Rashedul/stat545_guest_lecture/blob/master/cm010-exercise.Rmd) file we downloaded earlier.
